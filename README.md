This is a collection of tools and resources for processing Turkish. 
The list is still in its infancy.
The candidates to be included in this  more organized
list are collected [here](https://turkishnlp.github.io/list/).
If you have suggestions or corrections please contact 
create an issue [here](https://github.com/TurkishNLP/list/issues),
describing the resource, and providing appropriate links
and citation information.

## General purpose corpora 
- [METU Corpus](https://ii.metu.edu.tr/metu-corpora-research-group)
  (there are a few more specific corpora linked from this page)
- [Turkish National Corpus](https://www.tnc.org.tr/) is a larger corpus built
    in a more recent effort. However, the corpus is only accessible
    thorough the query interface. The full data (to my knowledge)
    is not released.
- [TS Turkish Corpus](https://tscorpus.com/) releases corpora in various domains including tweets, news columns, idioms and abstracts.
  

## Treebanks

- [Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) (UD) project
  includes three freely available treebanks,
  a few more are likely to arrive soon.

    - The [UD_Turkish-IMST](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish/)
        treebank has its roots
        in IMST and METU-Sabancı treebanks listed below
        (although content seems to differ).
        There is also 
        [a version](https://github.com/boun-tabi/UD_Turkish-BIMST)
        with a full correction/re-annotation effort. However, the
        changes are not incorporated to the version currently released
        by the UD project.

        Home pages of the earlier versions (with non-UD annotations)
        are:
            - [IMST](http://tools.nlp.itu.edu.tr/Datasets)
            - [METU-Sabancı treebank](https://ii.metu.edu.tr/metu-corpus-development-group) 
    - The [UD_Turkish-PUD](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-PUD/)
        treebank is created as part of the effort in
        [CoNLL 2017 shared task](http://universaldependencies.org/conll17/).
    - The [UD_Turkish-GB](https://github.com/UniversalDependencies/UD_Turkish-GB/)
        is a treebank constructed from grammar book examples
        ([Göksel and Kerslake (2005)](https://books.google.com/books?id=7fXCKZmee8QC)).
        The most up-to-date version of the treebank can be found
        [here](https://github.com/coltekin/gk-treebank).
