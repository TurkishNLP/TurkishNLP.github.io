This repository aims to keep pointers to tools and resources
for processing Turkish. 

Currently we have a relatively comprehensive
[list of corpora and lexical resources](https://turkishnlp.github.io/list/).
If you have suggestions or corrections please contact 
us by creating an issue [here](https://github.com/TurkishNLP/list/issues),
describing the resource, and providing appropriate links
and citation information.

More links/information on Turkish NLP tools and resources
will be linked from this page.
